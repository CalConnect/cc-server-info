== Terms and definitions

=== Application

An application running on one or more hosts at the network application layer and
above. The application may provide data storage, manipulation, presentation,
communication or other capabilities. The application may use a well defined
protocol and is often implemented with a client-server relationship.

A application will usually implement one or more features which may be defined
by standard specifications. Applications and features may also be constrained by
various limits.

Examples of applications are:

* caldav
* email
* File servers

=== Feature

A feature is some functionality provided by a application. For example, a DAV
based application may provide the versioning feature.

Applications need not support all features that are defined as an optional part
of that application. Some features may depend on the authenticated state and/or
the authorization of the authenticated principal.

Examples of features are:

* DAV versioning
* DAV access control
* CalDAV scheduling
