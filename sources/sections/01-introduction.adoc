== Introduction

Any given host on a network may support a number of applications. Each will have
limits or optional features. The advertising and discovery of applications,
features and limits is often through the use of properties and headers. As the
number of applications and features grows the amount of data and complexity of the
requests grows.

Additionally, headers and properties don't allow for caching mechanisms based on
etags. A client has to fetch all the information and compare with its stored copies
to determine if a application change has taken place.

This specification defines a new XML document type which can be retrieved from a
host and is easily extended to allow the description of complex applications. The
schema as described here only handles basic DAV applications. Other specifications
will extend this specification to define elements for other DAV based applications.
